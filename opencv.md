How openCV works:
from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlYPhdTbRmk
- when you load an image it extracts the pixels and loads them into a numPy array
- numpy - high performance array library within python
- when you print(img.shape) it gives the channels which is used for colour in an rgb format (bgr)
- in format [0,0,0]
- for colour anylasis (future reference): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddSo8Nb0mTw
- it uses the openCV corner detection to map
